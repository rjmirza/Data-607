You've been seething since Nov. 8, 2016. You've been calling your member of Congress and pleaded with your friends to do the same, even though deep down you're not sure it makes that much of a difference. You'll vote for the forward-thinking candidate this year, but you just wish there was something else you could do. There is.
In early 2017, we were in your shoes. But then we figured out how we could quickly, affordably, and accurately measure public opinion online - and we knew we could bring it to forward-thinking candidates and causes and help them win.
We're working on some really interesting problems with data, social science, and politics. And by solving them, we hope to make our democracy better.

What you’ll learn: how campaigns use (or don’t yet use) data; an intimate knowledge of our amassed polling data, including political attitudes across the countryIn 2020 and Beyond:
Expected skills: solve novel problems, and formulate your own product ideas that anticipate problems before they come up. Write code that rivals that of a senior engineer, and introduce new modeling techniques to the team.
Example project: design an Auto ML process for predicting novel variables
What you’ll learn: How to be part of a growing data science team, contributing both ideas and technical prowess. Become an integral part of our data science operation and help the company grow its impact in Democratic politicsA successful member of our team will demonstrate the curiosity to try new things, but the self-discipline to prize results over technique. We’re open to hiring for a range of levels. The specific job will be commensurate with a candidate’s work experience and potential.

Founder, Alex Coren created Wambi out of an unyielding need to bring human connection back to the center of patient care. Both personally and professionally, Alex spent time immersed in hospital settings, where care providers were rarely appreciated. It became apparent that this was leading to high burnout rates, and strongly affecting the quality of their care. To address this Alex leveraged technology to recognize and reward care providers in real-time with feedback obtained directly through the eyes of patients and their families. With her passion for technology, and commitment to compassion, Alex has been able to grow Wambi into the thriving startup that it is today.

Founded in 2016, Wambi, delivers a patient-driven healthcare employee performance and reward platform aimed at recognizing and empowering compassionate care. Through its gamified digital platform informed by real-time patient feedback, care providers are armed with their individual data as a means to promote autonomy and inspire behavioral change. Visit us atwww.wambi.org.

Wambi is about human connections. We are new and fresh, and we believe fun in the workplace is essential. We are not bogged down by the way things were done in the past, but rather are motivated to co-create a new normal. We are the nexus where tech, gratitude and human kindness meet. We are driven by a collective vision for a more compassionate and connected society.

You've been seething since Nov. 8, 2016. You've been calling your member of Congress and pleaded with your friends to do the same, even though deep down you're not sure it makes that much of a difference. You'll vote for the forward-thinking candidate this year, but you just wish there was something else you could do. There is.
In early 2017, we were in your shoes. But then we figured out how we could quickly, affordably, and accurately measure public opinion online - and we knew we could bring it to forward-thinking candidates and causes and help them win.
We're working on some really interesting problems with data, social science, and politics. And by solving them, we hope to make our democracy better.
